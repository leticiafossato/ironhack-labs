:point_right: LAB LEARNINGS:
- If some column have space in the name, I need to put the name into "" ;
- If the type of column is varchar, I need to feed the data using '', I can't use "" ;
- I need to put ; at the end of each command, because the space and the enter are equivalent;
- Smallint to store numbers until 35.000, if the number is bigger than that, use 'integer';
- Default of column names: lowercase. If I want to use some Capital letter, I need to write the column name between "".
