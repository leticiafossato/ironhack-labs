We have no idea whether this number is accurate but a data scientist indeed spends lots of time and effort in collecting, cleaning and preparing the data for analysis. This is because datasets are usually messy and complex in nature. It is a very important ability for a data scientist to refine and restructure datasets into a usable state in order to proceed to the data analysis stage.\n","\n","In this exercise, you will both practice the data cleaning techniques we discussed in the lesson and learn new techniques by looking up documentations and references. You will work on your own but remember the teaching staff is at your service whenever you encounter problems.\n","\n","## Getting Started\n","\n","Read the instructions for each cell and provide your answers. Make sure to test your answers in each cell and save. Jupyter Notebook should automatically save your work progress. But it's a good idea to periodically save your work manually just in case.\n","\n","\n","## Resources\n","\n","[Data Cleaning Tutorial](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_data_cleansing.html)\n","\n","[Data Cleaning with Numpy and Pandas](https://realpython.com/python-data-cleaning-numpy-pandas/#python-data-cleaning-recap-and-resources)\n","\n","[Data Cleaning Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOX18HfLHGQ)\n","\n","[Data Preparation](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2017/06/7-steps-mastering-data-preparation-python.html)\n","\n","[Google Search](https://www.google.es/search?q=how+to+clean+data+with+python)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"zuHDm8EtZD4X","colab_type":"text"},"source":["# Data Cleaning "]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"mzok3P1NZD4Z","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["import pandas as pd"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"JgKT-j3aZD4e","colab_type":"text"},"source":["# Read the users dataset.\n","\n","Take a look at what is the `users.csv` separator."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"1DvZ9W7rZD4f","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":[""],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"pmZ1D4wvZD4j","colab_type":"text"},"source":["## Check its shape\n","\n","See the number of rows and columns you're dealing."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"BQHpNkApZD4k","colab_type":"text"},"source":["## Use the .head() to see some rows of your dataframe."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"d39jdumRZD4l","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":[""],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"XhFTmi-hZD4o","colab_type":"text"},"source":["## Get the data info. \n","\n","Which columns have a great number of missing values?
